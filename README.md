# Hi

This is my 2023 Advent of Code repository. No generative code utilities were used in the formation of these solutions.

If you want to run things, you can do the following:

You'll need `Bun` to run this repo, which you can get here: https://bun.sh/docs/installation

One you have that, you can clone this repo and run:

```
bun install
bun test
bun run start
```

This will execute every day's code and produce the results for part 1 & 2 based on my inputs, which are stored in `inputs/`. You can also find my prompts in `prompts/`

Happy coding!
